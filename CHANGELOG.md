# Vault Rails Changelog

## v0.1.2.dev (Unreleased)

BREAKING CHANGES
- The API for configuration now lives under `Vault::Rails` instead of `Vault`.
  Existing users will need to update their configuration as follows:

  ```diff
  - Vault.configure do |config|
  + Vault::Rails.configure do |config|
  ```
- Remove testing mode and use an in-memory vault store in development and test
  instead with the option to disable

IMPROVEMENTS

- Allow specifying custom serialization options
- Add dirty tracking for Active Record models
- Unset instance variables when `reload` is called for ActiveRecord models
- Fix issues that would occur when using multiple threads

BUG FIXES

- Update documentation to better describe configuration options
- Update documentation around advanced configuration options
- Update documentation to include example Vault policies for the transit backend
- Do not attempt to read back a secret after writing to the logical backend
- Increase test coverage

- Do not automatically mount or create keys (security issue, see README for
  more information)
